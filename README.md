# SupercoNN
SupercoNN is project for the prediction of the temperature of superconductivity of materials based on a chemical formula by neural network.
--------------------------------------------
- In this project were used:
- Tensorflow 1.15.0
- Matplotlib 3.1.1
- NumPy 1.18.1
- Superconductivty Data Data Set - open dataset, containing superconductors chemistry formulas. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Superconductivty+Data

------------------------------------------------
Metrics of trained neural network for defalut test dataset:
- Root mean square error, RMSE 8.202
- Standard deviation, R2 0.923
- Mean absolute error, MAE 4.068
It mean that neural network can predict critical temperature of superconductivity of chemistry formula with accuracy 4.068 degree

------------------------------------------
How can you run and train this network:

1. Start prediction for your formulas

1.1 Put txt file with your chemistry formulas into folder “processed_data”. Structure of formulas must be as in file "formulas_example.txt". Order of elements in formula is not important for this version of neural network

1.2 Run "work_with_custom_formulas_pretrained_network.ipynb" file. In this file find variable "csv_custom" and insert there path to your file with formulas

1.3 If you want write results into file, change path to this file in variable "result_cs_writer" and set variable "write_it_into_file" True.  If you don’t want write results, set False

1.4 Run all cells in this ipynb file. 

2. Training process

2.1 (optional)Start file "parserBIG.ipynb". 
This file makes dataset processing for training process.
Processed data already is in folder "processed_data" in files "train_dataset.txt" and "test_dataset.txt"
This repository has not default dataset in this folder. 
You can download test dataset by link https://drive.google.com/open?id=1h-le5YqJKfOXUPhDARZxCq_D8qGT0BzJ
You can download train dataset by link https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jiiHWyCiTJSE6kwET9biYVn4FkbiI6XY
Put these datasets in folder "processed_data".
If you want crate your own dataset, you must remove default dataset.

2.2 Start training of different networks with different structure by files: 
- lstm_trainer.ipynb
- convolution_C1_trainer.ipynb
- convolution_C2_trainer.ipynb
- convolution_C3_trainer.ipynb
These files use loss "Mean Absolute Error"(MAE)
Pretrained models will be in folder "pretrained_data". 
This repository already has default pretrained models for default dataset 

2.3 Optimize pretrained networks for “Mean Square Error”(MSE) loss by file “mse_optimiser.ipynb” . In variables “model2j” and “model2h” show path to .json and .h5 files of pretrained model. In variable “json_file” and function “model.save_weights” show path , where optimized model will be saved.

2.4 Make ensemble of C2 and C3 networks by file “Ensemble_C2_C3_trainer.ipynb”. After training this network must be adapted for  MSE loss too.

2.5 All models were trained. Start file “Best_ensemble.ipynb”. In this file best ensemble will be created. Trained ensemble of neural network will be saved in folder “pretrained_nn”.

2.6 Test it for custom formulas. See p.1.

If you need more information, you can see it inside .ipynb files in comments.
